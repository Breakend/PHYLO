<B><U>The Problem</U></B>:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genetic sequences are difficult to understand and so to decipher their structure, we need to compare them to detect any similar regions they may have. Similar regions may indicate important elements of our genetic code. We have several genomes to align and we call this the multiple alignment problem.
<P><B><U>The Game</U></B>:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We abstract the multiple alignment problem to a game where the goal will be to align words made by pieces of different color instead of letters representing the genetic code (A,C,G,T). The sequences are displayed on a grid where you can only move them horizontally. Your goal will be to  create columns with the same colour. However this is not always possible.  Sometimes you will have to put different colors in these columns and you will be slightly penalized. More importantly, you will also need to create "gaps" (unoccupied positions in the grid). These gaps are also unavoidable and are strongly penalized. You goal is thus to find the best tradeoff between aligning color and creating gaps. The game works as follows: At the beginning you start with two sequences. You will try to find the best alignment and beat the score obtained by the computer. When you will succeed the star at the bottom-right will be illuminated - click on it to jump to the next stage. A new sequence is then added, and you now align three sequences. You will repeat the process until you have aligned all sequences.

<P>Have fun!
