<h1 class="info">Description of the scoring system</h1>

<p>
The scores of registered users is based on the number of puzzles that improve  the original DNA sequence alignment.
</p>

<p>
We re-inserted all puzzle solutions at their original position in the
44-species multiple sequence alignment. Players have been credited of 1 point
for every solution that increased the score of the complete genome alignment.
Of course, duplicates have been removed. We report various rankings:
</p>

<p>
<b>General ranking:</b> All puzzles considered. The players are sorted according to their total score.
</p>

<p>
<b>First contribution ranking:</b> Only the first player who found the 
solution that have been inserted received 1 point for the puzzle. Other 
received 0 points.
</p>

<p>
<b>Disease category ranking:</b> Only the puzzles whose sequences correspond
to one gene related to a disease belonging to the specified category are 
considered. The list of categories and related diseases is described in the
