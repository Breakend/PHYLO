Note
=====
If the features or dependancies under js/DNA does not fit for this part.  Either write an extension or create a new module, best not to modify js/DNA.<br>
Remeber if need to add a new file, please add it in index.html

Naming Schema
=====
if its an extension - \<module name\>.ext.\<file extension\> <br>
- eg: sequence.ext.js  <-- this will tell us you are extending the prototype from sequence.core.js from js/DNA <br>
if its a new module - \<module name\>.\<core | theme ... etc\>.\<file extension\> <br>
- eg: color.theme.js <-- this will tell us you defined a new module and its for theming.
