		    <B><U><a name="scoring">I don't understand the scoring scheme. Could you explain it a little more in-depth?</a></U></B>
		    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First I'll explain what an ancestral sequence is: Consider a simple example where we only
		      have two species, say A and B. Their phylogenetic tree would consist of three nodes - one for species A, one for B, and
		      one for their hypothetical common ancestor. Suppose we wanted to know what the genetic sequence of the ancestor looked like.
		      It would make sense that this sequence was somehow related to both species A and B, since A and B are its descendants. We can
		      infer the most <I>probable</I> sequence for this ancestor using 
		      <a href="http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ws06/albi1/script/phylogeny_31Jan2007.pdf">Fitch's Algorithm</a> (See section 11.18.3),
		      and this is exactly what Phylo does. Each time your current alignment is evaluated, these ancestral sequences are generated for ALL nodes of 
		      of the tree, given your current alignment. 
		      
		    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I'll talk about how we come up with some numbers. 
		      The way we compare the sequences is referred to as "the affine gap model" and works as follows: for every match, we increase the score by some amount (in our case, +1),
		      and likewise for every mismatch, we decrease the score by some amount (and again in our case, -1). What we mean by a match or mismatch is comparing the color in a
		      common column between the ancestor and its child; a column where both have the same color is a match, and a column where the colors differ is a mismatch. 
		      <BR>Gaps are a little different. A gap is opened at the first location where one sequence has a blank spot, and the other does not. Every subsequent blank space directly
		      adjacent to another blank spot is referred to as a gap extension. A gap only lasts as long as one sequences has consecutive gaps where the other does not. <B>Note that
			columns where both species have a gap are ignored. </B> Gap openings
		      are punished with a 5 point decrease, while an extension only with a 1 point decrease.
		      
		    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now it's time to explain exactly how the scoring works. Starting at the root of the tree (the very top - in this case, the hypothetical common ancestor of 
		      all species) we compare that ancestral sequence with its left child (the sequence directly below it in the tree, on the left), and then with its right child, using
		      the affine gap model just mentioned. We then proceed to the left child, repeat this process, and then proceed to the right child, and repeat this process. That is, 
		      we compare the left child with <I>its</I> left and right children, and the right child with <I>its</I> left and right children. We continue this process until every node
		      of the tree has been compared with its children (provided they have any. Note that the actual sequences you are aligning do not have any children in the tree). 
		      <BR><B>Your score is then the sum of all such comparisons.</B> It should be noted that small changes in closely related species have a large impact on the overall score; their 
		      common ancestor will be directly affected, as will its ancestor, etc. Because of this, you should focus the most on aligning species that are direct siblings in the tree (have a direct common ancestor). 
		      
		    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us return back to our previous example with species A and B. Suppose the alignment looked something like this:
		      
		      <font size="3">
			
			<pre> 
Species A: ACG--TT
Species B: ACGTTTA
			</pre>
			
		      </font>								Then the tree with the ancestral sequence and the sequences of A and B might look like:
<font size="3">
  
  <pre> 
        ACG--TT
       /
ACGTTTT
       \
        ACGTTTA
  </pre>
  
</font>
(If this is unclear, please refer to <a href="http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ws06/albi1/script/phylogeny_31Jan2007.pdf">Fitch's Algorithm</a>  - section 11.18.3). 
<BR>So let's calculate the score for this alignment. We'll start by comparing species A with the ancestral sequence. We have 5 matches (columns 1, 2,3, 6, 7), no mismatches, one gap open (column 4), and one gap extension (column 5). This gives a total of:
<font size="3">
  <pre> 
(5 * 1) + (0 * -1) + (1 * -5) + (1 * -1) = -1
  </pre>
</font> 
<BR> For the comparison of species B with the ancestor, we have 6 matches (columns 1 - 6), 1 mismatch (last column), and no gap opens or extensions. This score is then
<font size="3">
  <pre>
(6 * 1) + (1 * -1) = 5
  </pre>
</font> 
<BR>The <I>total</I> score for this alignment is then just
<font size="3">
  <pre> 
(comparison with A) + (comparison with B) 
= -1 + 5 
= 4
  </pre>
</font>

		    <B><U><a name="stats">When I hover my mouse over the stats, they are all zero. Why don't you fix this bug?!</a></U></B>
		    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see stats, click on a node of a tree. This will give you all the statistics you need to know 
		      about the alignment between the ancestral sequence represented by that node, and its two children (see <a href="#scoring">scoring</a>).
		      You can select multiple nodes. You can select multiple nodes quickly by drawing a box around them with shift + click and drag.  
		      
		      
		    <P>&nbsp;</P>
		    
		    <B><U><a name="instant_score">Why is my alignment not evaluated instantly?</a></U></B>
		    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can always have your alignment evaluated instantly by clicking the "Score now" button. The reason the score 
		      isn't evaluated in real time is for two reasons:
		      <UL>
			<LI>Evaluating an alignment isn't trivial. There are a lot of things that must be computed (see <a href="scoring">scoring</a>). Evaluating
			  an alignment between 8 species, for example, would cause performance issues on some older machines.</LI> 
			<LI>It adds an element of strategy to the gameplay. If the score were to be calculated in real time, you could just randomely move stuff around
			  until a star appears. The point of having you wait, or press the "Score now" button, is that we want you to really think about your moves
			  and be able to see and understand the consequences of certain modifications to your alignment.</LI>
		      </UL>

 		    <B><U><a name="data_origin">How are your puzzles built?</a></U></B>
		    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our data come from the
		      <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, which provides alignments
		      of genomes computed with classical algorithms. We extracted from these alignments,
		      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_%28biology%29">promoter regions</a>
		      (a region of the genome controlling the gene expression) which are poorly aligned,
		      and we transformed them into our puzzles.

 		    <B><U><a name="whats_next">What are you doing with my solutions?</a></U></B>
		    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once completed your puzzles are re-inserted into the complete
		      genome alignment and re-evaluated with a more sophisticated scoring system. If your
		      solution improves the computer score, we incorporate it into the alignment.<br/>
		      Phylo is absolutely non-profit. All results will be publicly available and nothing
		      will be sold. Once completed, the improved genome alignments will be available on our
		      website.
